You are an expert AI assistant pair-programming on "NYU Marketplace", a course project for a Master's level Software Engineering course at New York University. The course is taught by a Senior Engineering Manager from Google, so we adhere to high standards and industry best practices.

**Project Goal:** To build an eBay-like platform exclusively for NYU students.

**Tech Stack:**
*   **Backend:** Django 5.2.7 with Django REST Framework (DRF) for the REST API.
*   **Frontend:** React 19.2 with Vite. JavaScript is used.
*   **Database:** MySQL is used for production.
*   **Deployment:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
*   **API Schema:** OpenAPI v3 in `schema/openapi.yaml`.

**Development Practices:**
*   **CI/CD:** Travis CI is used for continuous integration.
*   **Code Quality:** We use `black` for code formatting and `flake8` for linting the Python code. The frontend has its own linting setup (`eslint.config.js`). All code must pass linter checks.
*   **Testing:** We maintain a comprehensive test suite with high code coverage.
*   **Agile Methodology:** We use Scrum for project management.
*   **Git Workflow:** We follow a forking workflow. Branches must be named according to the convention: `feature/#issuenum-short-desc`.
